     this file".


  On unixen including linuxen and macosen the configure script will
  generate 'mkconfig' and 'env'

      In this directory...

        ./configure    # (write 'ken-cc/mkconfig' && link 'ken-cc/bin')
        . ./env        # (prepend 'ken-cc/bin' to path per session)
        mk             # (build tools for host platform)
        mk install     # (install tools into 'ken-cc/bin')
