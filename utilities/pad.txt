The programs in this directory are not needed to cross compile C code,
but they are needed to build a few programs under fork-plan9
(especially the kernel).

The following programs are also assumed; most distributions
come with a compatible version:
 - ls (was originally needing the -p flag, but I've removed its need
   in the fork-plan9 mkfiles)
 - awk??
