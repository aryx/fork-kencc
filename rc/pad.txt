Porting rc to kencc was surprisingly difficult. I tried many things:
 - I adapted the rcsh/ included in kencc, but it was a stripped-down version
   that was working only for Windows. I thought I could extend
   it to work also under Linux but it did not work out.
   Imitating Nt.c in a Posix.c led to some progress but ultimately
   pipes were not working.
 - I copied rc/ from the latest plan9 which had a unix.c, but
   havefork.c was not compiling originally under kencc. I tried
   to use haventfork.c and fix it, but again pipes in the end were not working
 - I finally used havefork.c, but it was needing libstring/ 
   which was not in kencc. I tried to provide a stripped-down libstring
   but it pulled too many dependencies (locking, utf8)
 - I finally copy-pasted some code from plan9port regarding the import
   of PATH and the management of Xbackq which did not require libstring
