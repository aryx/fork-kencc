less: remove 5xx and vxxx stuff? after all I already do that in my plan9/,
people should use my kencc fork really just to bootstrap plan9.
But at the same time convenient to have original 5xx to test and compare with
my modified version.

less: same way no need acid? kprof? libregexp?

see install.txt for instructions on how to compile and install.
