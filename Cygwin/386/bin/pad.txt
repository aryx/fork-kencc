It was difficult to get a working mk.exe that would work
under cygwin. The mk in the original kencc in Nt/386/bin/mk.exe
was compiled with a shell (rcsh) that was hard to find.
It was looking for c:/inferno/Nt/386/bin/rcsh.exe
but even after setting up this dir, mk would still
sometimes exit saying it could find a shell.

In the end I produce myself Cygwin/386/bin/mk.exe
by compiling directly all the necessary source
(see the mk.sh scripts in lib9/, libbio/, libregexp/, and mk/).
I just saved the compiling trace under Linux and adapted
it for cygwin.

Once I had a working mk.exe under cygwin, I could compile
all the rest.
