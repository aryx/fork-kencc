Now at https://bitbucket.org/plan9-from-bell-labs/9-cc/
but this latest version is worst. Indeed, it does not even compile under
Linux and some files are actually missing from the repository.
The repository https://github.com/JehanneOS/devtools-kencc
fixed some mistakes, but I don't think it's a good starting point.
Indeed, those repositories do not incorporate the latest patches
to 5c that enable to compile Raspberry programs.

partial list of modifications:
- got rid of old hosts (NetBSD, Irix, etc), except 
  Linux/386, Macos/386, and Plan9
- got rid of old targets, except 386 (8) and arm (5)
- moved src/* and src/cmd/* at the toplevel
- compiled and commited a correct version of MacOSX/386/bin/iyacc
- updated the Rune type to 'unsigned int' so kencc can compile plan9 programs
  using L"..."
- fixed Linux/386/include/lib9.h to comply with recent Linux distributions.
- created Linux/386/lib/.keep and MacOSX/386/lib/.keep, etc. so
  'ar' can correctly create libraries
- added the Cygwin host (mostly a copy of Linux)
