** less: I could remove need acid? kprof? libregexp?
people should use this kencc just to bootstrap plan9. After that
just use acid/kprof/... under plan9!

** update from inferno-os?
looks like it contains the latest portable sources
kencc and 9-cc seems not uptodate

but at the same time, I don't think it has 5a/5c/... synced
with the latest plan9 versions 
(which I did sync to get a working raspberry pi build of plan9)

*** less: could copy the makemk.sh from inferno
so no need to have bootstrapped mk for all platforms in xxx/.../bin/mk
I started a bit with the mk.sh scripts in lib9/, libbio/ and mk/

** update from plan9port?

** update from plan9?

** less: figure out why cant use union with dbuf,
why was not working? print & of dbuf and obuf?
and why was working if you do a print before ...
really weird, probably bug gcc!

*** try clang under Linux? bug with dbuf too?

*** related to tordvalds recent rant about gcc and union and the C standard?

** less: support also native windows (in Nt/) like
in the original kencc
