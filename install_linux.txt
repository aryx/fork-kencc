For recent Linux versions you need to install a few packages to be able
to produce 32bits binaries on a 64bits architecture:
 - libc6-dev-i386, otherwise you will get an error about the inexistent
   sys/cdefs.h and gnu/stub-32.h files
 - linux-libc-dev:i386, otherwise you will get an error about the inexistent
   asm/errno.h file.
 - gcc-multilib, otherwise you will get an error during linking about a 
   missing libgcc.a
