On recent Linux distributions, you need to install a few extra
packages to be able to produce 32 bits binaries on a 64 bits architecture:
 - libc6-dev-i386, otherwise you will get an error about the inexistent
   sys/cdefs.h and gnu/stub-32.h files
 - linux-libc-dev:i386, otherwise you will get an error about the inexistent
   asm/errno.h file.
 - gcc-multilib, otherwise you will get an error during linking about a 
   missing libgcc.a
